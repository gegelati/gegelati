     * generation. In this agent, the roots are decimated based on an average
     * score **per class** instead of decimating roots based on their
     * global average score (over all classes) during the last evaluation.
     * By doing so, the roots providing the best score in each class are
     * preserved which increases the chances of correct classifiers emergence
     * for all classes.
     *
     * In this context, it is assumed that each action of the
     * LearningEnvironment represents a class of the classification problem.
     *
     * The BaseLearningAgent template parameter is the LearningAgent from which
     * the ClassificationLearningAgent inherits. This template notably enable

         * During the decimation process, roughly half of the roots are kept

         * score over all classes is not among the best.

         * The remaining half of preserved roots is selected using the general
         * score obtained over all classes.

         * sufficient number of root vertices in the TPGGraph after decimation
         * to guarantee that all classes are preserved equally. In other word,

         * which can only be achieved if the number of roots to preserve during
         * the decimation process is superior or equal to twice the number of
         * actions of the ClassificationLearningEnvironment. If an insufficient
         * number of root is preserved during the decimation process, all roots
         * are preserved based on their general score.

         * non-decimated roots.
