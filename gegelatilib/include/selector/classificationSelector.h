         * During the decimation process, roughly half of the roots are kept
         * based on their score for individual class of the
         * ClassificationLearningEnvironment. To do so, for each class of the
         * ClassificationLearningEnvironment, the roots provided the best score
         * are preserved during the decimation process even if their global
         * score over all classes is not among the best.
         *
         * The remaining half of preserved roots is selected using the general
         * score obtained over all classes.
         *
         * This per-class preservation is activated only if there is a
         * sufficient number of root vertices in the TPGGraph after decimation
         * to guarantee that all classes are preserved equally. In other word,
         * the same number of root is marked for preservation for each class,
         * which can only be achieved if the number of roots to preserve during
         * the decimation process is superior or equal to twice the number of
         * actions of the ClassificationLearningEnvironment. If an insufficient
         * number of root is preserved during the decimation process, all roots
         * are preserved based on their general score.

         * The results map is updated by the method to keep only the results of
         * non-decimated roots.
